\section*{Community Profile for Adams County}Demographic information is critical for making informed decisions at the local, state and national level.  This demographic profile is a summary of trends in a community.  The dashboard provides charts, text, data and additional links to assist  in the exploration and understanding  of demographic trends for counties and municipalities in Colorado.  The following collection of tables and charts establishes the context for assessing potential impacts and for decision-making.

The age, income, race and ethnicity, and migration of the population of a community are all vital in planning for service provision.  The most significant demographic transitions for Colorado and its communities are related to disparate growth, aging, downward pressure on income, and growing racial and ethnic diversity.\end{flushleft}\FloatBarrier\begin{table}[H]

\end{table}\FloatBarrier  At the end of 2016 the estimated population of Adams County was 497,419, an increase of 7,645 over the population in 2015.  The growth rate for Adams County between 2015 and 2016 was 1.6 percent compared to 1.6 percent for the State of Colorado.\FloatBarrier\begin{figure}[htp]\centering\includegraphics[scale=0.85]{{C:/Users/TBleess/AppData/Local/Temp/RtmpwlgVYC/filea802fea2eaf.png}}\end{figure}\FloatBarrierThe population of Adams County is forecast to reach 542,609 by 2020 and 774,542 by 2040. Overall, the growth rate for Adams County is expected to decrease between 2020 and 2040.  Between 2010 and 2020 the forecast growth rate was 2.0 percent, between 2020 and 2030 the forecast growth rate is 2.0 percent,  while the forecast growth rate between 2030 and 2040 is 1.6 percent.  The change is due in part to population aging and changes in the proportion of the population in childbearing ages.  Note: Population forecasts are only provided for Colorado counties.\FloatBarrier\begin{figure}[htp]\centering\includegraphics[scale=0.85]{{C:/Users/TBleess/AppData/Local/Temp/RtmpwlgVYC/filea801a453e15.png}}\end{figure}\FloatBarrier\textit{Components of Population Change} \begin{flushleft} Births, deaths and net migration are the main components of population change. Net migration is the difference between the number of people moving into an area and the number of people moving out. Change in net migration typically causes most of the changes in population trends because migration is more likely to experience short-term fluctuations than births and deaths. Migration also tends to be highly correlated to job growth or decline in communities where most of the residents work where they live. For many counties with negative natural increase (more deaths than births), this makes migration especially important for population stability and growth. \end{flushleft}\begin{figure}[htp]\centering\includegraphics[scale=0.85]{{C:/Users/TBleess/AppData/Local/Temp/RtmpwlgVYC/filea803d3a16f6.png}}\end{figure}Over the past five years, between 2012 and  2016, the population of Adams County has increased by 37,598 people. The total natural increase (births - deaths) over this period was 21,503 and the total net migration (new residents who moved in minus those who moved out) was 44,812.  Note: Components of Change data are only available for Colorado counties.\FloatBarrier

\section*{Age Characteristics}Every community has a different age profile and is aging differently.  People in different age groups work, live, shop, and use resources differently  and these differences will impact the economy,  labor force, housing, school districts, day care facilities, health services,  disability services, transportation, household income, and public finance.  An aging population may put downward pressure on local government tax revenue  due to changes in spending on taxable goods.\FloatBarrier\begin{figure}[htp]\centering\includegraphics[scale=0.85]{{C:/Users/TBleess/AppData/Local/Temp/RtmpwlgVYC/filea801315662d.png}}\end{figure}\FloatBarrierThe age distribution of the population of Adams County and Colorado are shown here.\FloatBarrier\begin{figure}[htp]\centering\includegraphics[scale=0.85]{{C:/Users/TBleess/AppData/Local/Temp/RtmpwlgVYC/filea807bef4d48.png}}\end{figure}\FloatBarrier\begin{table}[H]

\section*{Housing and Households}Understanding the current housing stock is critical for understanding how the community can best address current and future demands.  This section begins with a projection of households. The projection of households is derived by county specific headship rates for the population by age.  Beyond the numbers and characteristics, understanding the value and affordability of housing units is vital.  Are the housing prices prohibitive to new families?   Are the housing prices at such a high price that  once the current work force ages and sells, those housing units will most likely go into the vacation seasonal market?  Or are housing prices reasonable and suddenly the community is experiencing growth in families with children?  How many total housing units are there? What types of new units are being built - multi-family vs single family?\FloatBarrier\begin{figure}[htp]\centering\includegraphics[scale=0.85]{{C:/Users/TBleess/AppData/Local/Temp/RtmpwlgVYC/filea8071095734.png}}\end{figure}\FloatBarrierThe Household Estimates plot shows the current and projected number of households in Adams County between 2010 and 2050.\FloatBarrier\begin{flushleft}  The next several tables provide an overview of the housing stock in an area.  The availability of land and the cost of land can dictate whether housing is less dense, with a greater number of single family units or more dense with a number of multifamily apartments and condos.  Median home values and median gross rents are often considerably lower than current market prices as the  values are computed from a 5-year average that runs through 2016. The number of people per household can  offer insights as to the composition of the households .  Areas with a larger number of people per household  often have more families with children under 18 or a number of roommates living together to share housing costs. Those with a smaller number of persons per household, likely have a larger share of single-person households. \end{flushleft}\FloatBarrier\FloatBarrier\begin{table}[H]

\section*{Commuting}Commuting plays an important role in the economy of an area because not all workers live where they work. Commuting impacts local job growth, access to employees, and transportation infrastructure.\FloatBarrierThe Commuting diagram identifies three groups of people: \begin{itemize} \item People who work in Adams County, but live elsewhere. \item People who live in Adams County, but work elsewhere. \item People who live and work in Adams County. \end{itemize}\FloatBarrier\begin{figure}[htp]\centering\includegraphics[scale=0.85]{{C:/Users/TBleess/AppData/Local/Temp/RtmpwlgVYC/filea8022552594.png}}\end{figure}\FloatBarrier\begin{table}

Generally, migration patterns follow changes in job growth demand.

\section*{Employment by Industry}Identifying the industries which may be driving the growth and change within a community is a vital part of understanding community dynamics. Growth in jobs often results in growth in residents from migration within a community. Identifying the trends of growth or decline of jobs and the types of jobs available within the community is important.\FloatBarrier\begin{figure}[htp]\centering\includegraphics[scale=0.85]{{C:/Users/TBleess/AppData/Local/Temp/RtmpwlgVYC/filea80200af60.png}}\end{figure}\FloatBarrierThe Estimated Jobs is a series created by the SDO to give a comprehensive look at the number of jobs located within Adams County. It is broad in scope, capturing both wage and salary workers as well as most proprietors and agricultural workers.  A more diverse economy is typically more resilient too; when looking at the employment trends recently  and after a recession (shaded in gray) it is also important to look at the current share of employment by industry. Areas dependent on a single industry such as agriculture, mining or tourism can suffer from prolonged downturns due to drought, shifting demand for commodities, and the health of the national economy. \FloatBarrier The total estimated jobs are subdivided into 3 categories: \begin{itemize} \item \textit{Direct Basic:} jobs that bring outside dollars into the community by selling goods or services outside the county, such as manufacturing or engineering services,\item \textit{Indirect Basic:} jobs that are created as the result of goods and services purchased by direct basic such as accounting services or raw material inputs, and \item \textit{Local (Resident) Services:}  jobs that are supported when income earned from the base industries is spent locally at retailers or are supported by local tax dollars to provide services like education and public safety.\end{itemize}\begin{figure}[htp]\centering\includegraphics[scale=0.85]{{C:/Users/TBleess/AppData/Local/Temp/RtmpwlgVYC/filea8066941a0a.png}}\end{figure}\FloatBarrierThis plot shows the jobs by industry profile for Adams County.  The relative rank of high-paying sectors, such as mining, information and finacial and insurance services versus mid-range jobs (e.g., contsruction, health casre and government)  and lower-paying industrices such as retail trade and accomodation and food services,  will have an impact on a counties' overall economic health.\FloatBarrier\begin{figure}[htp]\centering\includegraphics[scale=0.85]{{C:/Users/TBleess/AppData/Local/Temp/RtmpwlgVYC/filea8050a45b71.png}}\end{figure}\FloatBarrier\FloatBarrier


\section*{Employment Forecast and Wage Information}Understanding the types of jobs forecast to grow in a community, if jobs are forecast to increase, will aid in further understanding potential changes in population, labor force, housing demand, and household income. Important questions to ask include;  What is the current forecast for job growth based on the current industry mix?   What types of jobs are forecast to grow?  What are the wages for those jobs? What are the labor force trends for the community? Is the labor force expected to grow or slow down?\FloatBarrier\begin{figure}[htp]\centering\includegraphics[scale=0.85]{{C:/Users/TBleess/AppData/Local/Temp/RtmpwlgVYC/filea806d0a5d0c.png}}\end{figure}\FloatBarrierThe total jobs forecast and population forecast are for Denver-Boulder MSA shown here.  The two lines diverge over time due to the aging of our population and continued growth in our under 18 population – two segments of the population that are less likely to be employed. Growth in the 65 plus population in the labor force through 2040 compared to the universe population of those over the age of 16 since labor force participation declines with age, especially among those eligible for pensions or social security. Note: Statistics for the counties in the Denver Metropolitan Statistical Area (Adams, Arapahoe, Boulder, Broomfield, Denver, Douglas and Jefferson) are combined in this section.\FloatBarrier\begin{figure}[htp]\centering\includegraphics[scale=0.85]{{C:/Users/TBleess/AppData/Local/Temp/RtmpwlgVYC/filea801e426626.png}}\end{figure}The inflation adjusted (real) average weekly wages for Adams County and Colorado are shown here. In 2016 dollars, wages in Colorado have been essentially unchanged since 2010. The gain or loss of a major employer such as a mine or a hospital can have a significant impact on a county’s average weekly wage. These wages are shown only for jobs located within that county and do not include most proprietors. Household income can be influenced by the average weekly wage, but in areas that have considerable amounts commuting or unearned income this relationship is not particularly strong.\FloatBarrier\begin{figure}[htp]\centering\includegraphics[scale=0.85]{{C:/Users/TBleess/AppData/Local/Temp/RtmpwlgVYC/filea8028c97170.png}}\end{figure}\FloatBarrierThis plot compares the forecast residential labor force to the forecast population of person age 16 and older for Adams County.\FloatBarrier\begin{table}[H]
